Deploy Static Website on AWS
============================

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project I was tasked to deploy a static website to AWS. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:
- Hosting a static website on S3
- Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service  
> CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.  

### Topics Covered
- S3 bucket creation
- S3 bucket configuration
- Website distribution via CloudFront
- Access website via web browser
